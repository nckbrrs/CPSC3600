HW1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This program is two UDP clients and one server
	The clients are named Yeller and Checker
	The Server is named caseInverter

The purpose of the yeller client is to send messages
	to the server which then inverts the case on each letter
	and sends the modified message back to the client.
	The checker client is to check the functionality of 
	the server by sending the returned inverted message
	back to the server a second time and checking the 
	final recieved message for equality with the original.

How to use:
	Type 'make' to create the executables needed.
	In on terminal type './caseInverter -p 6666' 
		*6666 is arbitrary it is your port number it should be
		between 5000 and 10000
	At this point your server is running
	This terminal should be hanging on an empty line
	Open up another terminal
	Type either "./yeller -p 6666 -s 127.0.0.1 -m "your Message""
		or "./checker -p 6666 -s 127.0.0.1 -m "your Message""
	-p comes before your server port
	-s comes before your server name or IP
		"localhost" will work if both terminals are on the 
			same computer.
	Hit enter
	
	For yeller you will get back the number of attempts, the time
		elapsed, the original message, and the inverted message.
	For checker you will get the same read out with the edition of 
		either verified if the final message comes back the same
		as the original or not verified otherwise.

	You will have to hit CTRL-C to kill the server
	After you kill the server it will print out the number of messages
		recieved and the unique IP addresses that contacted it
		while it was running.

This program is two TCP clients and one server
	The clients are named bellower and frank
	The Server is named caseConverter

The purpose of the bellower client is to send messages

	The frank client is to check the functionality of 
	the server by sending the returned inverted message
	back to the server a second time and checking the 
	final recieved message for equality with the original.
